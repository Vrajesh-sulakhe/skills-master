# Implementation Plan Template

Use this template as the standard header and task outline for every implementation plan.

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking. Implement task-by-task, verifying after each step.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

**Spec:** [path to the spec/design doc this plan implements — the plan argues from the spec, so the spec travels with it; executors read both]

## Global Constraints

[The spec's project-wide requirements — version floors, dependency limits, naming and copy rules, platform requirements — one line each, with exact values copied verbatim from the spec. Every task's requirements implicitly include this section.]

## Review Focus

[The five input classes or failure modes the spec implies but no task's tests exercise that are most likely to bite a person using this software — one line each, naming the input or condition and the behavior a reasonable person would expect, most likely first. The spec is a vision document: it says what the software must do, not everything it will meet, and its silence on an input is not permission for that input to break the program. Write the list here, once, with the spec in front of you. Then, for each line, add the test that pins it to the task that owns the code, in that task's own step style.]

### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: [what this task uses from earlier tasks — exact signatures]
- Produces: [what later tasks rely on — exact function names, parameter and return types]

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `function(input: InputType) -> ResultType` in `exact/path/to/file.py`**

[One line on the approach when the signature and the test leave a choice]

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
```
